## Project Description:
(In this assignment we are learning the importance of managing different changes made to our workstation.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version controls are used to help designers keep track of the different files that have been edited and their versions.)
2. (Github was created to make application designing easy. All the files used, come from your local computer so you can use Github practically anywhere.)
3. (A centralized version control can be problimatic and impractical if the server goes down, resulting in a loss of all files potentially.)

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the system that helps manage each change that a user makes to a file so that if needed, the user can go back and reference each change made. Version controls allows developers to view changes over time to compare differences. Local version control systems is a simple way to manage different versions of a file on one computer. A centralized version control system uses one server that contains many files and all of its versions. A distributed version control system is a group of many servers containing many duplicated of the all the different files and their corresponding versions.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Instead of acting as a VCS, Git acts as a mini file system with data acting like a stream of snapshots. Git responds fast because it uses mostly the local files from your computer, instead of gathering information over a network. This is convenient because even if you are offline, traveling, etc, you can still work with Git. Git also checksums everything. This ensures that no data is corrupted or lost. Committed, modified, and staged are the three states a file can exist in. Modified is when a file has been edited but isn’t ready to be committed. Staged is when a modified file’s current version goes into the next snapshot.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in a working directory are always either tracked or untracked. Files that are tracked are the ones in the most recent snapshot and are able to be edited, unedited or staged. A clean working directory is when no tracked files have been edited.  Files that are untracked are files not in your recent snapshot or staging area. The git status command can be used to check which state the file is in. The git status command will also output which branch the user is in and if the branch has or hasn’t come from the same server. By default, that branch is the master.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you need to track new files, use the git add command. The git add command can also be used to track new files, marking conflicted files ad solved, or stage files. Ignoring files is simple with the .gitignore command. When viewing staged and unstaged changes, use the git diff command to see exactly what change you made. Git commit is the command used to commit changes. Removing files is easy with the git rm command. Moving files can be done by the git mv command. The git log command lists the commits made in reverse order in the repository.

                <span class="text-muted">The cons of Version control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control has a lot of positive aspect and helps make coding easier to edit in a lot of ways, yet each of its methods have their downfalls. A common mistake made when using local version controls is forgetting which directory you are in and then editing a wrong file or accidently copying the wrong file. The Centralized Version Control System can be problematic if the single server crashes because no users will be able to access any files. On that server, if the central databases hard disk is tainted, every file can be lost. The centralized version control system has the most risk because all the files are stored in one place.
